## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or later). Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Flask Server
Run the following command to start the backend server:

```bash
python server.py
```

### 3. Open the Web Interface
- Open `static/index.html` in a web browser.
- Upload a password-protected bank statement and enter the correct password.
